### [Quantum Seminar] Srijita Kundu—[Are uncloneable proof and advice states strictly necessary?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11827)

Yes, we show that they are.
We initiate the study of languages that necessarily need uncloneable quantum proofs and advice. We define strictly uncloneable versions of the classes QMA, BQP/qpoly and FEQP/qpoly (which is the class of relational problems solvable exactly with polynomial-sized quantum advice). Strictly uncloneable QMA is defined to be the class of languages in QMA that only have uncloneable proofs, i.e., given any family of candidate proof states, a polynomial-time cloning algorithm cannot act on it to produce states that are jointly usable by k separate polynomial-time verifiers, for arbitrary polynomial k. This is a stronger notion of uncloneable proofs and advice than those considered in previous works, which only required the existence of a single family of proof or advice states that are uncloneable. We show that in the quantum oracle model, there exist languages in strictly uncloneable QMA and strictly uncloneable BQP/qpoly. The language in strictly uncloneable QMA also gives a quantum oracle separation between QMA and the class cloneableQMA introduced by Nehoran and Zhandry (2024). We also show without using any oracles that the language, used by Aaronson, Buhrman and Kretschmer (2024) to separate FEQP/qpoly and FBQP/poly, is in strictly uncloneable FEQP/qpoly.

### [Quantum Seminar] Ulysse Chabaud—[Can effective descriptions of bosonic systems be considered complete?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13857)

<img align="left" width="140" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/21fd3bb4-c6a0-4d1c-9093-9a81e8e78e7d" />

Bosonic statistics give rise to remarkable phenomena, from the Hong–Ou–Mandel effect to Bose–Einstein condensation, with applications spanning fundamental science to quantum technologies.
Modeling bosonic systems relies heavily on effective descriptions: typical examples include truncating their infinite-dimensional state space and restricting their dynamics to a simple class of
Hamiltonians, such as polynomials of canonical operators, which are used to define quantum computing over bosonic modes. However, many natural bosonic Hamiltonians do not belong to this
simple class, and some quantum effects harnessed by bosonic computers inherently require infinitedimensional spaces, questioning the validity of such effective descriptions of bosonic systems. How
can we trust results obtained with such simplifying assumptions to capture real effects?
Driven by the increasing importance of bosonic systems for quantum technologies, we solve this outstanding problem by showing that these effective descriptions do in fact capture the relevant
physics of bosonic systems. Our technical contribution is twofold: firstly, we prove that any physical, bosonic unitary evolution can be strongly approximated by a finite-dimensional unitary evolution; secondly, we show that any finite-dimensional unitary evolution can be generated exactly by a bosonic Hamiltonian that is a polynomial of canonical operators. Beyond their fundamental significance, our results have implications for classical and quantum simulations of bosonic systems, they provide universal methods for engineering bosonic quantum states and Hamiltonians, they show that polynomial Hamiltonians do generate universal gate sets for quantum computing over bosonic modes, and they lead to an infinite-dimensional Solovay–Kitaev theorem.

### [Quantum Seminar] Ravi Kunjwal—[What's nonclassical about indefinite causal order?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02565)

Causal inequalities are device-independent constraints on correlations realizable via local operations under the assumption of definite causal order between these operations. While causal inequalities in the bipartite scenario require nonclassical resources within the process-matrix framework for their violation, there exist tripartite causal inequalities that admit violations with classical resources. The tripartite case puts into question the status of a causal inequality violation as a witness of nonclassicality, i.e., there is no a priori reason to believe that quantum effects are in general necessary for a causal inequality violation. Here we propose antinomicity as a notion of nonclassicality for correlations in the presence of indefinite causality and prove strict inclusions between correlation sets classified by their antinomicity. This article provides a causal perspective on antinomicity, complementing the device-independent perspective adopted in arXiv:2411.11397. Besides providing important background to the results reported in arXiv:2411.11397, including proofs of key technical results, we also define a weight-based measure for the antinomicity of correlations that we term the antinomy weight of a correlation. We then investigate antinomic correlations in bipartite and tripartite scenarios with binary settings and outcomes. In doing so, we discover antinomic correlations that are impossible in the process-matrix framework.

### [Quantum Seminar] Mark M. Wilde—Machina ex Quanta: Rise of the Quantum Boltzmann Machines

<img align="left" width="140" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3cb99c12-a7f5-4ec8-a34d-5f033661d00a" />


Boltzmann machines are a well established model for classical machine learning, based on ideas rooted in physics like thermal distributions. Roughly eight years ago now, quantum Boltzmann machines were proposed as a generalization of their classical counterparts and can be understood as parameterized thermal states of local Hamiltonians. While this generalization allows for non-commuting Hamiltonians inaccessible in the classical case, training them for various optimization tasks had remained an obstacle. In this talk, I'll discuss how my coauthors and I have overcome this obstacle by deriving analytical expressions for the gradient and providing quantum algorithms that can estimate it. The algorithms make use of standard primitives such as the Hadamard test, classical sampling, and Hamiltonian simulation. I'll also show how to train quantum Boltzmann machines using a metric-aware gradient descent algorithm, which makes use of analytical expressions we have derived for quantum generalizations of the Fisher information matrix and quantum algorithms we have constructed for estimating information matrix elements. Finally, I'll introduce a new model called evolved quantum Boltzmann machines, which uses parameterized time-evolved thermal states as an ansatz, extending the conventional model of quantum Boltzmann machines. Evolved quantum Boltzmann machines incorporate real and imaginary time evolution according to two different non-commuting parameterized Hamiltonians, and they can also be trained using metric-aware gradient descent. If time permits, I'll mention applications of our findings to estimating time-evolved thermal states. Based on joint work with Daniel Koch, Michele Minervini, Dhrumil Patel, Saahil Patel, and available at arXiv:2410.12935, arXiv:2410.24058, and arXiv:2501.03367.

### [Quantum Seminar] Achim Kempf—Encrypted Qubits can be Cloned 
We show that encrypted cloning of unknown quantum states is possible. Any number of encrypted clones of a qubit can be created through a unitary transformation, and each of the encrypted clones can be decrypted through a unitary transformation. The decryption of an encrypted clone consumes the decryption key, i.e., only one decryption is possible, in agreement with the no-cloning theorem. A possible application of encrypted cloning is to enable encrypted quantum multi-cloud storage. Beyond applications in cryptography, encrypted cloning could provide a form of redundancy, parallelism, fault tolerance or scalability where direct duplication is forbidden by the no-cloning theorem.

### [Quantum Seminar] Kishor Bharti—[Pseudorandom quantum authentication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00951)

<!-- <img align="left" width="140" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/db048bbd-b64f-4065-8cde-0029af4d164e" /> -->

<img align="left" width="140" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1bd23b7d-0cd1-416e-81dd-54f53587ae7b" />

We introduce the pseudorandom quantum authentication scheme (PQAS), an efficient method for encrypting quantum states that relies solely on the existence of pseudorandom unitaries (PRUs). The scheme guarantees that for any eavesdropper with quantum polynomial-time (QPT) computational power, the encrypted states are indistinguishable from the maximally mixed state. Furthermore, the receiver can verify that the state has not been tampered with and recover the original state with asymptotically unit fidelity. Our scheme is cost-effective, requiring only polylogarithmic circuit depth and a single shared key to encrypt a polynomial number of states. Notably, the PQAS can potentially exist even without quantum-secure one-way functions, requiring fundamentally weaker computational assumptions than semantic classical cryptography. Additionally, PQAS is secure against attacks that plague protocols based on QPT indistinguishability from Haar random states, such as chosen-plaintext attacks (CPAs) and attacks that reveal meta-information such as quantum resources. We relate the amount of meta-information that is leaked to quantum pseudoresources, giving the concept a practical meaning. As an application, we construct important cryptographic primitives, such as verifiable pseudorandom density matrices (VPRDMs), which are QPT-indistinguishable from random mixed states while being efficiently verifiable via a secret key, as well as verifiable noise-robust EFI pairs and one-way state generators (OWSGs). Our results establish a new paradigm of quantum information processing with weaker computational assumptions.

### [Quantum Talk] Aryaman Kolhe—A Study of Bias-Preserving Gates
In realistic quantum hardware, the noise channel could be more biased towards either X or Z errors, so it is possible to construct fault-tolerant schemes that focus on handling this biased noise. However, the application of certain gates during computation can change this noise bias, which leads to the study of bias-preserving gates, whose properties will be discussed in this talk.
